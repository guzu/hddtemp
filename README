DESCRIPTION
===========
hddtemp will show you the hard drive temperature if the hard drive can
(modern drives support this feature).


COPYRIGHT
=========
This software is distributed under the GPL license.
Please see COPYING file.


INSTALLATION
============
Run ./configure (see --help for options), then just type 'make' and don't forget
to get the last hddtemp.db file on the site :

$ wget http://www.guzu.net/linux/hddtemp.db

By default, the hddtemp.db will we searched in /usr/share/misc directory but
you can change this at compilation time with the --with-db-path option:

$ ./configure --with-db-path=/etc/hddtemp.db



INFORMATION
===========
hddtemp accesses to the SATA disks via ATA pass-through commands (defined in 
T10/04-262r7). At the time of writing (kernel 2.6.11-rc5 has just been 
released), kernels doesn't have support for ATA pass-through. You have to 
update the libata driver with a newer version that could be found on:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/libata/

In daemon mode, hddtemp doesn't allow too much query at a time. If the interval
between two query is inferior to 1 minute, hddtemp will give the previous value
(hddtemp query the disk for each connection, if the period is superior to 1
minute).
After starting hddtemp in daemon mode, you can test it with a simple telnet
or netcat:

$ telnet localhost 7634
or
$ netcat localhost 7634

(note: sometimes the netcat command is called nc).

If you know that your drive has a temperature sensor and is reported to be
unsupported tell me which model and which manufacturer it is, and/or just
add a new entry in hddtemp.db. Each line of hddtemp.db is either a commentary,
a blank line or a line containing:
 - a regular expression that allow hddtemp to recognize a drive or a set of drives
   from its model name or from a generic model name,
 - a value (ATTRIBUTE_ID from S.M.A.R.T.),
 - a description.

The separator option allows to specify a separator in the case the drive's name
contains the default separator. Be carefull not to use '?' or '*' which could
exists in the reply of hddtemp.
